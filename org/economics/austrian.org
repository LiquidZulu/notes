* Topics
** Praxeology
Praxeology is the study of human action, it provides a framework for understanding the purposeful behaviour of man. Any praxeological argument with sound logic and accepted axioms is necessarily true.

#+begin_quote
Praxeology represents an attempt to escape the nihilistic implications of both historicism and empiricism. It affirms the operation of inviolable laws within the realm of human action.

Praxeology stands opposed to mainstream economic modelling in that it relies entirely on logical derivations from axioms to construct economic /theories/, not simply economic models. Moreover these theories may only be contested by discovery of a fault in ones line of reasoning, not by looking to historical examples --- a praxeological argument can only be countered with another praxeological argument.

Praxeology relies on the assumption that humans act purposefully, which is [[the Axiom of Action]]. It implies the notion that value, wealth, profit, loss, and costs are all products of human thought, having no objective foundation --- one cannot imagine their existence or conceive their alteration outside of a connection with acts of subjective valuation and choice.

Sense data alone, moreover, could not reveal to us the essential purposefulness of human actions, to refute a praxeological argument one must discover a fault in the chain of reasoning employed by the praxeologist. Empirical evidence may only serve to establish the appropriateness of a theory's application to a particular event.

Praxeology is distinct from psychology in that it simply wishes to describe subjective valuations and choices not to uncover the underlying motivations, thoughts, or ends from which they rose. Moreover, praxeological theories, as understood by Mises, are independent of the particular psychological makeup of individual --- praxeology does not address the /content/ of individual preferences or the particular motives that gide rise to those preferences, it is solely concerned with the purle /logic/ of choice.

*** Purposeful Behaviour
The [[the Axiom of Action][Action Axiom]], "human action is purposeful behaviour," describes mans conscious aiming at ends and selection of means to achieve those ends. This is distinct to unconscious behaviour such as involuntary reflexes.

Reflexes or situations outside of a mans control, such as an illness or the weather, are all facts that a man must take into account when acting. There are situations when a man can succeed through the power of his will in overcoming sickness, or he can compensate for physical inefficiencies, or he can train himself to suppress reflexes. As far as this is possible the field of purposeful behaviour is extended, and thus praxeology may be used in analysis.

When praxeology speaks of action, it does not just speak of having preference, but actually /showing/ preference. There are situations where a man shows preference for things outside of his control --- Crusoe may well prefer it to be sunny than rainy, but this is entirely outside of his control. The acting man specifically chooses means to reach an end that he values more than his current situation --- if there are two things that a man cannot have at the same time he must select one and give up the other, /showing/ a preference, moreover this means that action involves taking and renunciation at the same time.

Praxeology doesn't distinguish between active or passive action --- there's no difference between a cook who shows up to work every day and an unemployed college graduate who chooses to stay home instead of looking for work. Moreover, if you have the ability to change the future, and are aware of this ability, it does not matter whether you choose to do something or not, you show a preference either way and therefore act either way.

*** Prerequisites of Action
A man acts when he is eager to resolve some state of uneasiness --- his environment is in some unsatisfactory state, and he wishes to substitute this for a more satisfactory state. His mind imagines conditions that could suit him better and  his action aims at bringing about these desired conditions. Moreover, if and only if a man believes his action could bring about a better state of affairs can he act.

Here we have defined the three prerequisites of action:
1. A state of uneasiness.
2. An imagined world without this uneasiness.
3. The belief that a proposed action will bring about this imagined world.

Without all three of these you cannot have purposeful behaviour, and thus you cannot have action.

For example if you remove the state of uneasiness you destroy mans incentive to act, and you make a choice between this uneasy state and a better state impossible. You are no longer talking about a real man, but a perfectly content individual who never wants for anything, and has no reason to change his situation.

If you remove the imagination of a world without this uneasiness, man has no ability to substitute it for his uneasy world, as it does not exist in his mind. Moreover without the ability to imagine a changed world man has no ability to imagine actions that may bring about the desired change, so no action is possible --- every man would simply be submitting himself to the whims of destiny in such a world.

*** The Rationality of Action
Action is always necessarily rational, as an acting man is always aiming his action to satisfy some desire. The terms rational and irrational are meaningless with respect to the subjective goals of a man.

Suppose that Steve has to decide whether to go to a park or to a Beatles concert, and he chooses to go to the park. Peter calls Steve's decision irrational, but this cannot be true as what Steve values is up to him alone. The only think Peter claims to know here is what he would have done in the same situation.

Now let's imagine that Steve actually wanted to go to the Beatles concert but someone told him that it would be held in the park, when it actually wasn't, can Peter now call Steve's decision irrational? Steve went to the wrong location, but he was acting on the information available to him --- he did his best. Moreover, just because a man fails to achieve his end does not mean that the means he employed were irrational --- since no one is in a position to substitute their own values for those of another it is futile to pass judgements on the values of an acting man, the only place where a praxeologist may pass judgement is on whether the means chosen are fit for achieving the desired end. This means that, in short, praxeology is [[Value-Free][value-free]].

*** Ends and Means
When man acts the result he wishes to achieve can be called his end, his goal, or his aim --- these terms are interchangeable in praxeology. When man acts he always seeks to remove some uneasiness and his end is the desired state without this uneasiness.

For a man to achieve his desired end he must employ a means. A thing becomes a means when human reason plans to employ it for the attainment of some end and human action is what actually employs it for this purpose.

It's important to note that neither ends nor means exist in the physical universe without man --- in the universe there are no means, there are merely things, man is required to give these things meaning. When praxeology speaks of ends and means it is referring to the conscious meaning man gives to the world around him. If he has a goal he wishes to achieve it is because his mind percieves some uneasiness but this may not be empirically observed by other people and praxeology never refers to it as such.

A goal starts as an idea a man holds internally and becomes a real goal when he acts to achieve it. Likewise, things first have to be identified in the mind of man as serviceable --- man has to apply a meaning to a think that he thinks can achieve his goal. These things become means when an acting man actually employs them in an attempt to reach some end.

*** Scale of Values

** Economic Calculation
/See: [[https://mises.org/library/how-do-we-calculate-value][Ludwig von Mises, "Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis," pp. 113-122]] for more information/

Human action is the exchange of one condition for another.

** A Priori
/A priori/, to Mises, means "independent of any particular time or place." It does not imply independence from all experience, although it does denote independence from the sort of sensory experience that empiricism and positivism emphasize:
#+begin_quote
It rests on universal inner experience, and not simply on external experience, i.e., its evidence is reflective rather than physical.[fn:1]
#+end_quote
** Axiom
** Postulate
** Value-Free
Value-free, aka /wertfrei/, is one of the most basic notions of Austrian economics, taken from Max Weber by Mises.

* Axioms
** the Axiom of Action
This is the axiom that man acts [[Purposeful Behaviour][purposefully]]. This axiom is not merely analytic (i.e. non-empirical or vacuous), it is based upon the reality of the pursuit of ends and the choice of means for their attainment that distinguishes all mental (and, hence, human) activity.[fn:2]

Meaningfully denying this axiom is difficult, denial of the axioms empirical validity involves a purposeful act on the sceptics part. It therefore confronts them with the uncomfortable choice of either ceding the issue or proclaiming that their own disagreement is purposeless.

Yet this axiom is neither empty nor arbitrary (see: [[A Priori]]), it is axiomatic in the sense that it distinguishes an /[[Axiom][axiom]]/ from a /[[Postulate][postulate]]/. It is epistemologically distinct from the [[A Priori][a priori]] assumptions employed in the hypothetical-deductive procedures of orthodox, neoclassical economics.[fn:3]
