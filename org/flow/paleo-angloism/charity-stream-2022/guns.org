#+TITLE: Gun Laws in the USA, UK, and the Anglosphere

* Notes
** Uvalde shooting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF5hsI2Bxbc
+ aydin doesnt trust the feds
** Borer argument for NAP
+ a conflict resolution system (law) has 4 options for who to deny in a given conflict:
  1. deny the aggressor (NAP)
  2. deny the victim (victim can just aggress back and we have the mere-possessor ethic)
  3. deny both (contradiction when A wants to kill B and B wants to not be killed)
  4. deny neither--might makes right (argumentation ethics)
