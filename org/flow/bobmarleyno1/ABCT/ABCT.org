#+TITLE: Debate on Austrian Business Cycle Theory

* Notes
** Structure of Production
What does it take to make a ham sandwich?
+ Ham
  + butcher
    + land and labour
    + fridge
    + knives
+ Bread
  + bakery
    + land and labour
    + oven
    + flour
+ Lettuce
  + farming
+ Mayo
  + farming
+ Plate
  + plate factory
+ Table/chairs
  + furniture manufacturer
+ Land (deli, standing room, etc)
+ Labour
Everything will eventually terminate in land and labour.
+ time dimension, the butcher needs a knife before he can cut the ham, but theres also spending by entrepreneurs in every stage.
+ hayekian triangle: earlier stages require less spending than later stages (why?). The price spread between stages in ERE (taking out uncertainty) is interest, i.e. investors invest in something today for expected returns in the future.
** Sustainable Growth
*** Graphical overview
+ the fact that there are differing rates of time preference means that the high time preference can borrow from the low time preference.
+ tradeoff between consumption and investment; we can consume today and have less to invest, or we can invest today and have less to consume.
+ an increase in saving corresponds with a decrease in consumption and increase in investment
+ When there is more investment we get a lower interest rate and more loans
+ the hayekian triangle gets squished down because people are deciding to consume less (save more) and gets longer, so there is more investment in the earlier stages of production with less investment in later stages

Because consumers are consuming less this frees up resources for use in production. Lower discount on earlier factors of production makes it such that it will be relatively cheaper to make new capital goods
*** Textual overview
Saving involves freeing up resources for production. In credit markets, saved funds are made available to entrepreneurs to purchase factors of production. New, longer lines of production are started, which is in line with consumers' time preferences. The additional investment (in excess of what is required for maintaining/replacing existing capital stock) pays off with an expanded set of resources in the future, i.e., economic growth.
** Unsustainable Growth
Artificial credit expansion in that you just pump additional funds into the credit markets that does not correspond with an increase in peoples desire to save. The newly created money entering through credit markets represents an increased supply of loanable funds.
+ interest rate falls but not because of a decrease in time preference
+ At the lower interest rate, saving decreases
+ Consumption and borrowing increase
+ firms take the new funds and invest in new, longer lines of production
+ factor prices are bid up across the board. Wages increase, employment increases, consumption increases, investment spending increases.
+ In short, we have a general /boom/.
** Overconsumption and Malinvestment
Artificial credit expansion causes overconsumption and malinvestment. Overconsumption because consumers did not show that they preferred future output to present output, in fact, they /decreased/ saving at the lower interest rate.

The credit expansion does not represent an increase in real resources available for consumption or investment.
+ factors of production become increasingly scarce
+ Prices are bid up higher than entrepreneurs expected
+ Costs increase, expected profits turn into losse
+ projects are abandoned

Malinvestment - entrepreneurs were led to believe consumers had saved, real resources were available for production, and that longer, more capital-intensive production would be profitable.

** Lessons learned
If you look at highly aggregated data, you misdiagnose the problem and give bad solutions---you had to look at the malinvestment in the different stages of production to be able to see the errors, you had to disaggregate.

Sustainable production is based on a real reallocation of resources away from consumption, i.e., real savings.

Unsustainable booms are caused by artificial increases in credit. Recessions are the time when we fix the mistakes of the past.
** Block on government discounting investment
Present discounted value on a dollar over a year say, is how much you would be willing to bid to receive that dollar in a year given some interest rate. If you have an interest rate of 4% the present discounted value is $.96, and at 3% its $.97. So if government artificially lowers the interest rate from 4% to 3% it encourages investors to invest in this project of 1 years duration because it increases the value of it by about 1%---there will be a tendency enacted towards investments of this sort. But crucially this effect is far stronger in long-term investments, at 70 years we have it that the present discounted value of a dollar at 3% and 4% respectively is $.12 and $.06, namely it doubled. So artificial lowering of interest rate encourages long-term investments a lot.

The market interest rate, on the other hand, is determined by the time preference of consumers, i.e. how desperate they are to get the good now. So if the market interest rate is 4% and the government sets it at 3%, then entrepreneurs are lead to invest in longer-term projects than they would otherwise.

* The argument
** Sustainable Growth
+ If there is a change in time preference such that more people save this leads to more funds available for credit markets
+ This opens up credit for entrepreneurs to purchase factors of production
+ New, longer lines of production are started, which corresponds to the consumers' lower time preferences.
+ The additional investment pays off with an expanded set of resources in the future---economic growth
** Unsustainable Growth
We are increasing loans without people actually foregoing consumption.
+ there is additional credit without the corresponding increase in savings as the time preferences of consumers has remained the same
+ This additional credit means more loanable funds to entrepreneurs meaning longer lines of production
+ interest rate falls[fn:1] meaning consumption and borrowing increase
+ because the fall in interest rate was artificial and didnt reflect consumers' TP, consumers are therefore overconsuming
+ factor prices are bid up due to the increase in investment
+ Wages increase, employment increases, consumption increases, investment spending increases.
+ In short, wea have a general /boom/.
+ Eventually these factor prices go way higher than the entrepreneurs expected they would have because there was no true saving backing up those additional loans
+ So entrepreneurs have to start re-allocating capital---we are now in a bust.

* flow
+ using "overinvestment" rather than malinvestment
+ no such thing as natural interest rate
+ doesnt know why people would keep making the same mistakes
+ doesnt know why there is unemployment during the boom if not enough demand in the goods sector (its over-employment)
+ interest rates are low not because of the fed
  + interest rates can indeed fall over time, but that doesnt explain the business cycle
+ credit expansion doesnt cause business cycles
+ can you explain why it is that there is seemingly a massive clustering of entrepreneurial errors in a cyclic manner?
  + not malinvesting

* Footnotes

[fn:1]interest is the "price" of money, and you have just ramped up the supply.
