*** Problems
+ suppose you have a genuine public good, that entrepreneurs cannot produce. This does not then imply that welfare is improved by robbing people to provide it

* Questions

    + property rights is not a right unless its enforced
      + was the holocaust a rights infringement
        + it was
          +
+ commitment problems
  + when you took something theres no obligation to fulfil trade?

+ what are rights
  +
  + if given by state how is holocaust an
+ "should have"
  +
+ why not work?
  + commitment problems
    + when one player enacts a trade and the second
+ why extinction
  +
+ game theory
  +
+ every mercenary interaction prisoners dilemma
  + start company
  + see guy with pistol
  + hes your bodyguard
+ not interrupting would be a first lol
+ defender (zulu) attacker is that anarchism wont work
  + collective action problem
    + coordination problem
  + free rider problem
    + not the same thing
    + anarchy is free rider as nobody is incentivised to provide public goods
  + commitment problem
    + no 3rd party
      + why not?
        + if decentralised theres nothing preventing from being bought out
          + is one less likely to be bought out
            +
