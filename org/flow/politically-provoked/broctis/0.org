* Notes
** Insurance
+ insurers are forced to insure that which is un-insurable (conditions you can systematically influence)
  + restrictions on the right of refusal
+ insurance involves the pooling of risks, it implies that there will be winners and losers
+ insurers are required to
  1. enroll everyone who applies ("guaranteed issue")
  2. cover pre-existing conditions
  3. adopt a policy known as "community rating" where they must charge the same premium to all with minor exceptions for geographical area and age
     + there is a limit on how large the difference can be between, say, the very young and very old
+ insurance companies earn only 2.2 cents on the dollar in profit
