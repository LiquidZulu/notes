* Opening Statement
A free-market leads to every market participant profiting from the market, as there is mutual profit in every voluntary trade, and socialist action is necessarily a perversion of this and as such reduces the ability of market participants to attain their ends and reduces profit for the losers. Furthermore, this sets up two distinct groups, a group of winners, and a group of losers, namely there is a group who are getting the funds distributed to them, and there is a group that is having funds sucked from them, this is a two tiered system and is thus also inherently not egalitarian which socialists claim to be.

* Notes
** Ownership
The owner of a thing is he who gets the final say on what is done with that thing in the event of a dispute over its use.
