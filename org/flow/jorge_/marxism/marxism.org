#+title: Marxism debate

* Notes
** ECP
1. Socialism implies the abolition of the private direction of the factors of production
2. sans private direction of the factors, factor prices are impossible
3. without factor prices economic calculation is impossible
4. without economic calculation production decisions are made in the dark
c. a socialist central planner cannot allocate factors into their most value-productive uses

** Marxian Exploitation Theory
+ the capitalist provides present satisfaction to the workers in exchange for future satisfaction
  + "the capitalist does nothing!"---the capitalist has abstained from consumption--saved--which is then advanced to the workers in the present
  + the capitalist assumes the risk
+ mutual profit
+ why is it labour which determines the value of goods? Why not weight?
+ "an oak-tree of a hundred years possesses a higher value than corresponds to the half minuteâ€™s labour required in planting the seed is too well known to be successfully disputed"
