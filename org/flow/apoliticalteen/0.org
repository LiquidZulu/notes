* Notes
** Anarchy Defintion
+ No rulers
** Ruler Definition
+ One who imposes rules on others
** Public property is not anarchy
1. anarchy is a system with no rulers
2. public property requires management or else it is simply nature
3. In the management of public property some individuals will necessarily not have their desire for that property taken, assuming not every individual has the same values
4. Those individual's would be having rules imposed on them by someone
5. that someone is a ruler
6. \therefore public ownership is not anarchistic.
** "ancap isnt anarchy then because you impose rules on other people for how to use private property"
+ crusoe example --- trade isnt having rules imposed on you.
** Public property isnt possible
1. ownership is the exclusive say over how something may be used
2. public property prevents anyone from having exclusive say
3. public property is not truly owned
4. \therefore public property is self contradictory
** Workers owning the means of production means
1. no need for the state to enforce class anymore
   + I would not have class be enforced by the state as I would not have a state
2. no need for money anymore because moneys only purpose is to represent the commodity form
   + money is also useful for trade, sound money naturally arises in a free-market.

        + whats structural coercion
          + the way societies set up necessitates certain actions for it to move in a certain structure
            + give an algorithm
              + its absurd
                + so no algorithm?
                  + no individuals are structurally coercive
                    + is seizing
+ YOU DO HAVE A SAY OVER YOUR MIND
+ say is when you are able to tell others what you can
