#+title: Open Borders Debate

* flow
+ welfare, taxes
  + doesnt, need the bundling
    + why does it need bundling?
      + subidising the immigration is separate---it has to be individuated
        +
+ engage in behaviour that goes towards restoration of private property rights
  + homeless
+ domestic vs international migration
  + state created distinction
    + domestic involves citizens, taxpayers---is it a crime for a tax evader to go from new hampshire to minnesota
      + a citizen is a statist category, what is the relevant difference
        + foreigners are a type of tax evader
          + storkistan
        +
+ then what is the relevant difference between foreigner and citizen then wrt migration?
  + foreigner has different (priviledged) taxes
    + why relevant?
+ name the trait for domestic vs international migration
  + the state says so
    + we dont care about the state
      + it has to have some rational difference
        + why does it matter that the state sets these difference, like what specifically about that changes the law on this matter
          +
      + there are private borders, rape is seen as a crime
+ open borders requires abolishing arbitrary distinctions between citizen and foreigner
  + opening borders starts this process
    + bad strategy
      + crises are propagated by states, crisis from free immigration would be significant
        + what crisis?
+ "priviledged labour"
  + blacks are priviledged at the expense of whites, this does not imply we should exclude blacks from the
+ not a leftist point---bernie!
+ open borders means free immigration---forced integration
  + why forced integration? Forced against whom?
+ private property owners cant discriminate against immigrants---forced integration
  + the civil rights act is forced integration, not opening the borders
    + people being gay
      + all gay people must be forcibly married to other people, then virginia gives taxpayer money to gays to move there
        + who is it criminal against for the gay to move there?
+ immigration as a crime against society
  + martian in Utah
    +
+ opening borders incentivises further state aggression
  + immigrant not aggressor therefore not just to stop his immigration
    + not
+ "if theres no state theres no right to stop him from coming in"
  + how does the state change this?
+ who has the right to exclude me from the public park
  +
+ group property => contradiction
  + a stick is divisible
  + whether something is divisible is subjective
    +
  + a property right is a praxeologic, not a physical category
  + all public possessions is one entity---no its unowned
    + you can divide if it is a relevant praxeologic unit
      +
  + a well---everyone in the villiage uses the well to use the water
    + I dont want the well to be used in a given way
    + does not resolve the contradiction
+ open borders is a /lack/ of a state policy, its the lack of enforcement
  +
+ open borders necessitates property invasion
  + how?
    + the intentions are irrelevant
    + no aggressor means no crime,
      + the state is the aggressor, both in closed and open borders
        + open borders necessitates additional aggression
          + explain how!
+ taxpayers own park
  + they own the tax funds
    + if I steal your money and buy a pineapple with it do you own the pineapple or the money?
      + I steal 10k from Fabian, I use it to buy a pineapple,
        + you dont own the pineapple AND the 10k
          + buying the pineapple was fraudulant
            +
+ what if all the state did was control the borders, would opening the borders mean more aggression?
  +
+ "ask Fabian if he supports preventing employers from doing business with foreign workers"
+ if you cut taxes, you get more inflation
  + this does not make tax cuts bad
