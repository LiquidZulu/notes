#+TITLE: Anarcho-Capitalism debate w/ nationalist

* notes
#+begin_quote
I'm a Nationalist first and foremost. I have mixed views on economics and the degree to which a state should act.

IE; I support the state protecting the environment, but I don't support banning the usage of plastic in consumer products.

IE; I support the legalization of marijuana and other light substances, but I don't support the legalization of hard drugs.

IE; I'm against most forms of gun control, but I do support background checks, mandatory training, and confiscating arms from the mentally ill.
