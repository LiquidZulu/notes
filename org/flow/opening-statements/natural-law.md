For centuries, economics and ethics have been bifurcated into two separate disciplines; economics being a value-free &ldquo;positive&rdquo; science and ethics being a &ldquo;normative&rdquo; science if it was even referred to as a science at all. Murray Rothbard in his two Magna Opera, *Man Economy and State*, and *The Ethics of Liberty* successfully rediscovers the common origin of both sciences in a theory of property. On the one hand such core concepts in economics as aggression, fraud, and exchange rely on a prior theory of property to make any sense at all; similarly in ethics, or more specifically political philosophy, any ethic one proposes implies a system of property rights assignments.

Rothbard in deliberating upon how one could come to the discovery of a rational ethic recognised two properties any ethic for man must satisfy:

1.  universalisation&#x2014;the ethic must apply to all of humanity or else it would not be a human ethic
2.  the ethic must assure the survival of mankind, as the entire purpose of ethics is to determine how to *live* ones life. Moreover no anti-life ethic could possibly ever be proposed as argumentation, being an action, requires the party in question to be alive to do the proposing.

In these two properties Rothbard saw a proof for his ethics in the form of an argumentum e contrario; if it is not the case that a person, A, was the owner of his body and all goods appropriated by him, two possibilities remain:

1.  another person, B, is the owner of A and all goods appropriated by A
2.  all things are universally co-owned, A and B are equal owners of each other and all goods aquired by either party.

(1) fails on the grounds of not being a universal ethic&#x2014;it describes a society of two distinct classes; humans and sub-humans

(2) fails on two separate grounds:

1.  first, it would lead to the extinction of humanity as in order to act one would have to ask everyone else for permission to act, which is itself an action, meaning no action could occur&#x2014;a denial of the acting nature of man.
2.  second, co-ownership itself is impossible, as it cannot handle disputes over the co-owned means between co-owners, making it nonsensical to discuss as a property right.

It is in this recognition of a rational ethic that Rothbard re-discovered the natural law theory of old, systematising the diffuse truths into a modern, rational, framework much like his colleague Ludwig von Mises had for praxeology, the science of human action. Rothbard used as his foundation the works of the late Scholastics including the great St. Thomas Aquinas, through to more recent natural law theorists such as John Locke and Hugo Grotius.

Furthermore one can show that no other ethic may be rationally justified, even if we remove the necesscity to adhere to the properties of a human ethic. We show this through the modern-day successor to Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe&rsquo;s masterful argument from argument. This argument notes first and foremost that truth claims can only be raised and disputed in the course of an argumentation, called the *a priori* of argumentation. Second argumentation does not exist in a normative void, it does not consist of free-floating propositions not tied to any proposer, rather argumentation is an action, requiring the use of scarce means. This therefore implies that one could never propose a norm that violates the norms entailed by the act of argumentation.

As an example, one could never argue that it is pointless to argue; this would be called a dialectic contradiction as the proposition is negated by the very fact of its proposal. Norms of this sort&#x2013;that cannot be proposed as they contradict one or more norms entailed in the act of arguing&#x2013;are denoted as dialectically false, or irrational norms. Applying this to the property rights ethic, we have that argumentation is a conflict-free way of interacting, it requires that both parties make exclusive use of scarce means towards the same end. If in the course of an argument I threatened my opponent with death if they dared to disagree with me I would not actually be engaging in an argument, as I would not follow the pre-requisite notion that I agree that I may be wrong on the matter and that I want to be right on the matter, and that I hope that my opponent may be able to show me to the truth should they have it.

-   each person entitled to control over his own physical body so as to be able to act independently and come to a conclusion autonomously (he cannot be a mouthpiece)
-   [point about only needing body parts required by argumentation], the point is not about not aggressing against certain body parts, its about not aggressing to solve the dispute in any way.
-   peaceful conduct is a subset of non-aggressive conduct
-   add a note about how argumentation is a very specific type of interation and that you cant just arbitrarily choose that the end of your engaging in argumentation is any arbitrary end. [like how the end of trade must be to raise oneself on his value scale (other examples?)]
-   if the conclusions derived in an argumentation only matter during the argumentation thir applies to everything
-   dialectic contradiction to deny access to a yardstick when a yardstick is required to settle the dispute
-   If it was the case that argumentation did not pre-suppose mutual recognition of exclusive control over ones body, it would be the case that one or more parties in the argumentation would be unable to reply.
