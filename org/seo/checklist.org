#+TITLE: SEO Checklist

Note, "I" is quite often meaning the character of the story, often the youtuber themselves.

** Points to hit [0/16]
+ [ ] who's the character?
  + [ ] their want?
  + [ ] their need?
  + [ ] their flaw?
  + [ ] how do they grow?
  + what story/journey could the above create?
+ [ ] what's the desire/motivation of the story?
+ [ ] what's the obstacle?
+ [ ] what're the stakes --- why is it important?
+ [ ] make them care
  + [ ] show what you have so the audience feels the loss when you lose it
+ [ ] what's the resolution --- the one core idea that is the final message of the video that wraps everything up?
  + deliver on the title and thumbnail
+ [ ] storyboard it [0/3]
  + [ ] storylines you have
  + [ ] hook for each
  + [ ] different things that can happen
+ [ ] attach a story to every point I make and tell the story before I make that point
+ [ ] answer questions using spectacle
+ [ ] if things go static stories die, because life is never static.
+ [ ] drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty
+ [ ] make comment goals (2 or 3)
+ [ ] cater to the archetypal viewer
+ [ ] reference popular media
+ [ ] Make an audience proxy (state things the viewer is thinking)
+ [ ] Problem every 2 minutes
** Intro [0/4]
+ [ ] 8 words right at the start explaining the concept
+ [ ] Personal (character) motivation
+ [ ] Create an enemy
** Questions to ask [0/11]
+ [ ] is there incentive to watch until the end?
+ [ ] can I add something?
+ [ ] what are the different loops that I can open?
+ [ ] what are the different questions that the viewer could ask themselves?
+ [ ] what's the hook?
+ [ ] what do viewers need to see in the first few seconds based on the title and thumbnail so that they feel like their click is worth it?
+ [ ] is there a way to make the viewer laugh or feel surprised or feel something in the first 10 seconds?
+ [ ] is there a way to have two storylines?
  + [ ] surface level story, and hidden stories (finding nemo is ostensably about finding nemo, but really about marlon addressing his insecurities as a father)
  + [ ] is there a way to build surface level and underlying tension in each story?
    + short term: will dory's short term memory make her forget what marlon told her, long term: will we find nemo?
+ [ ] am I giving them 4 or 2+2?

+ [ ] in doing X big thing [0/3]
  + [ ] what do I want?
  + [ ] what happens if I dont get what I want?
  + [ ] what will I do to get what I want?
** Editing [0/5]
+ [ ] Show where possible
+ [ ] if theres a bit of information where you can delete what is before and after it and it flows just as well, cut it
+ [ ] tell stories with B-roll
+ [ ] Keep pace as fast as humanely possible, without impacting the pacing
+ [ ] add breather moments to allow for the pace to not feel too fast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8ZbGnwXjj4
** How to keep people watching [0/23]
+ [ ] deliver on title and thumbnail (video "I ate 100 bananas" shouldnt start with people eating apples or you buying bananas)
+ [ ] /exceed/ the expectations made by the thumbnail
+ [ ] instantly explain the payoff
+ [ ] tell them why to watch
+ [ ] get right into content after delivering
+ [ ] remove every dull moment
+ [ ] find 10 most critical people you know to roast your video
+ [ ] payoff at the end
+ [ ] you can make anything work but it has to be interesting to the audience, original, and good
+ [ ] big stunts
+ [ ] the title should be "bananas are the best food on the planet" rather than "I like bananas"
+ [ ] consider what the experience will be for people in the video, if they liked it they might want to watch more of your videos.
+ [ ] viewers can tell when you are half-assing
+ [ ] (storyline) have an objective
+ [ ] stay on topic
+ [ ] no filler, only content that is neccesary to the narrative and meets the expectations
+ [ ] for payoff have the clear goal that is teased throughout the video
+ [ ] build anticipation to the payoff
+ [ ] wait until the very end to give the payoff
+ [ ] watchtime is not created equal, engagement and viewer surveys will differentiate between a good 25min video and a great one
+ [ ] Signal to the viewer early on that you know something that they dont, e.g. "I've uncovered something about Elon Musk that nobody is talking about."
+ [ ] Get rid of signposting, e.g. over-explaining and ‘telling’ the viewer what's about to happen instead of ‘showing’ them.
+ [ ] subtly re-introduce the hook at several points in the video, most viewers forget what the incentive to watch is 5 or 6 minutes in
** Thumbnail
+ concept more important than aestethics
+ borrow from other successful videos (yoink and twist)
+ make the dominant subject someone people know (so not me when starting off)
+ provide action
+ portray the story of the video
+ other parts of the image shouldnt take focus away from the important, clickable, elements
+ confusion doesnt make people want to click, curiosity \ne confusion
+ should be accurate in the most visually applealing way
+ should be simple and clear
+ colourful and bright
+ have 2-3 different versions of the thumbnail to A/B test
+ check how they look across youtube (thumbsup.tv)
+ recognisable figures improve CTR
+ you probably only want 1 person in your thumbnail (obviously just a rule of thumb)
+ spike their curiosity so much that they will wonder what happened if they dont click
** Title
+ "and this happened" is better than "what happens next will shock you"
+ a good title says what it needs to say in as few characters as possible
** End Screen
+ Next logical step
+ What do the avatars care about?
+ Make people want to know what happens next.
+ be persuasive
  + mention the avatars desire
  + point out what more there is for them to do
    + use "have to"
  + describe the result of them doing that.
+ be confident that the linked video is good
