** Media they consume
*** Youtube Channels
+ top channels my viewers watch
  + Anglo Libertarian
  + Mises Institute
    + I think they wish that they watched intellectual stuff like this more but cant always find the time to sit through an hour long lecture
  + John Stossel
  + Springtime of Nations
+ why they watch them
  + Anglo Libertarian
    + contain a lot of information that a newer libertarian may not know about without being so long
  + Mises Institute
    + many great libertarian minds giving lectures on just about every topic
  + John Stossel
    + fast, simple videos that dont require your total focus to understand.
** Their day
+ what the first thing they think about in the morning is
  + they wonder what new developments there were in any arguments they were in the night before
+
** Their motivations
+ they want to be more able to win arguments online by knowing more about libertarianism
+ they want to bring about a libertarian world
+ they want to prove to everyone that they are right
** What is their level of knowledge
+ they know some basic libertarianism, but want to hone their arguments further, and/or have a video ready to crush anybody who doesnt understand libertarianism
  + this video needs to be able to both expand their knowledge and give them a springboard for debate, it need not provide some brain worm the ability to fully understand the topic.
