#+TITLE: Meta Checklist

* The Viewer Avatar
** Media they consume
*** Youtube Channels
+ top channels my viewers watch
  + Anglo Libertarian
  + Mises Institute
    + I think they wish that they watched intellectual stuff like this more but cant always find the time to sit through an hour long lecture
  + John Stossel
  + Springtime of Nations
+ why they watch them
  + Anglo Libertarian
    + contain a lot of information that a newer libertarian may not know about without being so long
  + Mises Institute
    + many great libertarian minds giving lectures on just about every topic
  + John Stossel
    + fast, simple videos that dont require your total focus to understand.
** Their day
+ what the first thing they think about in the morning is
  + they wonder what new developments there were in any arguments they were in the night before
+
** Their motivations
+ they want to be more able to win arguments online by knowing more about libertarianism
+ they want to bring about a libertarian world
+ they want to prove to everyone that they are right
** What is their level of knowledge
+ they know some basic libertarianism, but want to hone their arguments further, and/or have a video ready to crush anybody who doesnt understand libertarianism
  + this video needs to be able to both expand their knowledge and give them a springboard for debate, it need not provide some brain worm the ability to fully understand the topic.
* Choice of videos
** Choosing a topic
+ should be simple and easy to understand, no specific context should be required (for my case, I think context minimisation is the goal)
+ should be as interesting as possible
+ relevant to what is delivered
+ as an example, "I got hunted by the FBI" is far more appealing than "I got hunted by my brother"
** Choosing a title
+ short
+ simple
+ easy to understand
+ "offering people 100k to quit their job" is better than "offering people in random restaurants 100k to quit their job"
** Other
+ build anticipation for videos
